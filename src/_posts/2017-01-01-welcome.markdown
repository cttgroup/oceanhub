This guide is patterned after my ["Doing well in your courses"](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html), a post I wrote a long time ago on some of the tips/tricks I've developed during my undergrad. I've received nice comments about that guide, so in the same spirit, now that my PhD has come to an end I wanted to compile a similar retrospective document in hopes that it might be helpful to some. Unlike the undergraduate guide, this one was much more difficult to write because there is significantly more variation in how one can traverse the PhD experience. Therefore, many things are likely contentious and a good fraction will be specific to what I'm familiar with (Computer Science / Machine Learning / Computer Vision research). But disclaimers are boring, lets get to it!

### Preliminaries

</div>


First, should you want to get a PhD? I was in a fortunate position of knowing since young age that I really wanted a PhD. Unfortunately it wasn't for any very well-thought-through considerations: First, I really liked school and learning things and I wanted to learn as much as possible, and second, I really wanted to be like [Gordon Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Freeman) from the game Half-Life (who has a PhD from MIT in theoretical physics). I loved that game. But what if you're more sensible in making your life's decisions? Should you want to do a PhD? There's a very nice [Quora thread](https://www.quora.com/I-got-a-job-offer-from-Google-Facebook-Microsoft-and-I-also-got-accepted-into-the-PhD-in-Computer-Science-program-at-MIT-Stanford-Berkeley-What-factors-should-I-consider-while-making-a-choice-between-the-two) and in the summary of considerations that follows I'll borrow/restate several from Justin/Ben/others there. I'll assume that the second option you are considering is joining a medium-large company (which is likely most common). Ask yourself if you find the following properties appealing:

**Freedom.** A PhD will offer you a lot of freedom in the topics you wish to pursue and learn about. You're in charge. Of course, you'll have an adviser who will impose some constraints but in general you'll have much more freedom than you might find elsewhere.

**Ownership.** The research you produce will be yours as an individual. Your accomplishments will have your name attached to them. In contrast, it is much more common to "blend in" inside a larger company. A common feeling here is becoming a "cog in a wheel".

**Exclusivity**. There are very few people who make it to the top PhD programs. You'd be joining a group of a few hundred distinguished individuals in contrast to a few tens of thousands (?) that will join some company. 

**Status.** Regardless of whether it should be or not, working towards and eventually getting a PhD degree is culturally revered and recognized as an impressive achievement. You also get to be a Doctor; that's awesome.

**Personal freedom.** As a PhD student you're your own boss. Want to sleep in today? Sure. Want to skip a day and go on a vacation? Sure. All that matters is your final output and no one will force you to clock in from 9am to 5pm. Of course, some advisers might be more or less flexible about it and some companies might be as well, but it's a true first order statement.

**Maximizing future choice.** Joining a PhD program doesn't close any doors or eliminate future employment/lifestyle options. You can go one way (PhD -> anywhere else) but not the other (anywhere else -> PhD -> academia/research; it is statistically less likely). Additionally (although this might be quite specific to applied ML), you're strictly more hirable as a PhD graduate or even as a PhD dropout and many companies might be willing to put you in a more interesting position or with a higher starting salary. More generally, maximizing choice for the future you is a good heuristic to follow.

**Maximizing variance.** You're young and there's really no need to rush. Once you graduate from a PhD you can spend the next ~50 years of your life in some company. Opt for more variance in your experiences.

**Personal growth.** PhD is an intense experience of rapid growth (you learn a lot) and personal self-discovery (you'll become a master of managing your own psychology). PhD programs (especially if you can make it into a good one) also offer a *high density* of exceptionally bright people who will become your best friends forever.

**Expertise.** PhD is probably your only opportunity in life to really drill deep into a topic and become a recognized leading expert *in the world* at something. You're exploring the edge of our knowledge as a species, without the burden of lesser distractions or constraints. There's something beautiful about that and if you disagree, it could be a sign that PhD is not for you.


**The disclaimer**. I wanted to also add a few words on some of the potential downsides and failure modes. The PhD is a very specific kind of experience that deserves a large disclaimer. You will inevitably find yourself working very hard (especially before paper deadlines). You need to be okay with the suffering and have enough mental stamina and determination to deal with the pressure. At some points you will lose track of what day of the week it is and go on a diet of leftover food from the microkitchens. You'll sit exhausted and alone in the lab on a beautiful, sunny Saturday scrolling through Facebook pictures of your friends having fun on exotic trips, paid for by their 5-10x larger salaries. You will have to throw away 3 months of your work while somehow keeping your mental health intact. You'll struggle with the realization that months of your work were spent on a paper with a few citations while your friends do exciting startups with TechCrunch articles or push products to millions of people. You'll experience identity crises during which you'll question your life decisions and wonder what you're doing with some of the best years of your life. As a result, you should be quite certain that you can thrive in an unstructured environment in the pursuit research and discovery for science. If you're unsure you should lean slightly negative by default. Ideally you should consider getting a taste of research as an undergraduate on a summer research program before before you decide to commit. In fact, one of the primary reasons that research experience is so desirable during the PhD hiring process is not the research itself, but the fact that the student is more likely to know what they're getting themselves into.

I should clarify explicitly that this post is not about convincing anyone to do a PhD, I've merely tried to enumerate some of the common considerations above. The majority of this post focuses on some tips/tricks for navigating the experience once if you decide to go for it (which we'll see shortly, below).

Lastly, as a random thought I heard it said that you should only do a PhD if you want to go into academia. In light of all of the above I'd argue that a PhD has strong intrinsic value - it's an end by itself, not just a means to some end (e.g. academic job).

**Getting into a PhD program: references, references, references.** Great, you've decided to go for it. Now how do you get into a good PhD program? The first order approximation is quite simple - by far most important component are strong reference letters. The ideal scenario is that a well-known professor writes you a letter along the lines of: "Blah is in top 5 of students I've ever worked with. She takes initiative, comes up with her own ideas, and gets them to work." The worst letter is along the lines of: "Blah took my class. She did well." A research publication under your belt from a summer research program is a very strong bonus, but not absolutely required provided you have strong letters. In particular note: grades are quite irrelevant but you generally don't want them to be too low. This was not obvious to me as an undergrad and I spent a lot of energy on getting good grades. This time should have instead been directed towards research (or at the very least personal projects), as much and as early as possible, and if possible under supervision of multiple people (you'll need 3+ letters!). As a last point, what won't help you too much is pestering your potential advisers out of the blue. They are often incredibly busy people and if you try to approach them too aggressively in an effort to impress them somehow in conferences or over email this may agitate them.

**Picking the school**. Once you get into some PhD programs, how do you pick the school? It's easy, join Stanford! Just kidding. More seriously, your dream school should 1) be a top school (not because it looks good on your resume/CV but because of feedback loops; top schools attract other top people, many of whom you will get to know and work with) 2) have a few potential advisers you would want to work with. I really do mean the "few" part - this is very important and provides a safety cushion for you if things don't work out with your top choice for any one of hundreds of reasons - things in many cases outside of your control, e.g. your dream professor leaves, moves, or spontaneously disappears, and 3) be in a good environment physically. I don't think new admits appreciate this enough: you will spend 5+ years of your really good years living near the school campus. Trust me, this is a long time and your life will consist of much more than just research.



### Adviser

**Student adviser relationship**. The adviser is an extremely important person who will exercise a lot of influence over your PhD experience. It's important to understand the nature of the relationship: the adviser-student relationship is a symbiosis; you have your own goals and want something out of your PhD, but they also have their own goals, constraints and they're building their own career. Therefore, it is very helpful to understand your adviser's incentive structures: how the tenure process works, how they are evaluated, how they get funding, how they fund you, what department politics they might be embedded in, how they win awards, how academia in general works and specifically how they gain recognition and respect of their colleagues. This alone will help you avoid or mitigate a large fraction of student-adviser friction points and allow you to plan appropriately. I also don't want to make the relationship sound too much like a business transaction. The advisor-student relationship, more often that not, ends up developing into a lasting one, predicated on much more than just career advancement.

**Pre-vs-post tenure**. Every adviser is different so it's helpful to understand the axes of variations and their repercussions on your PhD experience. As one rule of thumb (and keep in mind there are many exceptions), it's important to keep track of whether a potential adviser is pre-tenure or post-tenure. The younger faculty members will usually be around more (they are working hard to get tenure) and will usually be more low-level, have stronger opinions on what you should be working on, they'll do math with you, pitch concrete ideas, or even look at (or contribute to) your code. This is a much more hands-on and possibly intense experience because the adviser will need a strong publication record to get tenure and they are incentivised to push you to work just as hard. In contrast, more senior faculty members may have larger labs and tend to have many other commitments (e.g. committees, talks, travel) other than research, which means that they can only afford to stay on a higher level of abstraction both in the area of their research and in the level of supervision for their students. To caricature, it's a difference between "you're missing a second term in that equation" and "you may want to read up more in this area, talk to this or that person, and sell your work this or that way". In the latter case, the low-level advice can still come from the senior PhD students in the lab or the postdocs.

**Axes of variation**. There are many other axes to be aware of. Some advisers are fluffy and some prefer to keep your relationship very professional. Some will try to exercise a lot of influence on the details of your work and some are much more hands off. Some will have a focus on specific models and their applications to various tasks while some will focus on tasks and more indifference towards any particular modeling approach. In terms of more managerial properties, some will meet you every week (or day!) multiple times and some you won't see for months. Some advisers answer emails right away and some don't answer email for a week (or ever, haha). Some advisers make demands about your work schedule (e.g. you better work long hours or weekends) and some won't. Some advisers generously support their students with equipment and some think laptops or old computers are mostly fine. Some advisers will fund you to go to a conferences even if you don't have a paper there and some won't. Some advisers are entrepreneurial or applied and some lean more towards theoretical work. Some will let you do summer internships and some will consider internships just a distraction. 

**Finding an adviser**. So how do you pick an adviser? The first stop, of course, is to talk to them in person. The student-adviser relationship is sometimes referred to as a marriage and you should make sure that there is a good fit. Of course, first you want to make sure that you can talk with them and that you get along personally, but it's also important to get an idea of what area of "professor space" they occupy with respect to the aforementioned axes, and especially whether there is an intellectual resonance between the two of you in terms of the problems you are interested in. This can be just as important as their management style.

**Collecting references**. You should also collect references on your potential adviser. One good strategy is to talk to their students. If you want to get actual information this shouldn't be done in a very formal way or setting but in a relaxed environment or mood (e.g. a party). In many cases the students might still avoid saying bad things about the adviser if asked in a general manner, but they will usually answer truthfully when you ask specific questions, e.g. "how often do you meet?", or "how hands on are they?". Another strategy is to look at where their previous students ended up (you can usually find this on the website under an alumni section), which of course also statistically informs your own eventual outcome.

**Impressing an adviser**. The adviser-student matching process is sometimes compared to a marriage - you pick them but they also pick you. The ideal student from their perspective is someone with interest and passion, someone who doesn't need too much hand-holding, and someone who takes initiative - who shows up a week later having done not just what the adviser suggested, but who went beyond it; improved on it in unexpected ways.

**Consider the entire lab**. Another important point to realize is that you'll be seeing your adviser maybe once a week but you'll be seeing most of their students every single day in the lab and they will go on to become your closest friends. In most cases you will also end up collaborating with some of the senior PhD students or postdocs and they will play a role very similar to that of your adviser. The postdocs, in particular, are professors-in-training and they will likely be eager to work with you as they are trying to gain advising experience they can point to for their academic job search. Therefore, you want to make sure the entire group has people you can get along with, people you respect and who you can work with closely on research projects.
